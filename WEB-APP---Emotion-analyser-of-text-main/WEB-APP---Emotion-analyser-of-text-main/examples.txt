the day we went for college was so joyful - joy
i felt so disgust when he talk to me like that - disgust
i was so frightened to talk on stage - fear
when my teacher scolded me i was so sad -sad
i was so angry when i got reject in interview - anger
when dad gifted that ring to her as of sudden she was very surprised - surprise
